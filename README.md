# 🐝 BeeTrack – Apiary Management System

BeeTrack is a full-featured backend & frontend system for managing an apiary business: hives, inspections, product inventory, orders, user roles, and automated background tasks.

Built for real-world use with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, cron jobs, Alembic, and JWT-based authentication - now with a modern React + Tailwind CSS frontend.

## 📁 Seeded Data

### 👥 Users

-   **Admin role:** admin
-   **Worker role:** worker, john_doe, jane_smith

_All users have default passwords based on their username (e.g., `admin123`, `worker123`)._

---

### 🍯 Products

Eight types of honey with different characteristics and unit prices:

-   Linden, Buckwheat, Rapeseed, Forest
-   Acacia, Heather, Sunflower, Wildflower

Each product includes a name, description, unit price, and stock quantity.

---

### 🐝 Hives

Four hives located across different apiaries (North, South, East, West), each with:

-   current status (`active` or `inactive`)
-   last inspection date

---

### 🔍 Inspections

A set of 8 detailed inspections, varying by:

-   date and temperature
-   detected diseases (`none`, `varroa`, `nosema`)
-   inspection notes

All inspections are linked to specific hives via `hive_id`.

---

### 🧾 Orders

20 orders including:

-   user, date, total price
-   order status (`pending`, `completed`, `cancelled`)
-   detailed items (product, quantity, unit price)

This dataset allows you to:

-   test many-to-many relationships
-   generate real-world sales statistics
-   verify export functionality (CSV/PDF)

---

## 🐳 Docker Notes

### 🧱 Backend (FastAPI)

-   `entrypoint.sh` runs:

    1. Alembic migrations
    2. Seed data if the database is empty
    3. Uvicorn server (`uvicorn app.main:app`)

-   `logs/` and `exports/` directories are mounted into the container and excluded from the Docker image via `.dockerignore`.

-   Backend is available by default at: `http://localhost:8000`

---

### 🧑‍💻 Frontend (React + Vite)

-   The frontend is built and served by **Nginx** in a separate container.
-   Default URL: `http://localhost:3000`
-   React Router-based routing is handled by `nginx.conf` using `try_files $uri /index.html`.
-   The environment variable `VITE_API_URL` should point to the backend address, e.g., `http://localhost:8000`.

---

### 🧪 Running the full environment

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

After launch:

-   Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
-   Backend docs: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

---

### ⚠️ Notes

-   The frontend container depends on the backend (`depends_on: api`), but make sure that `VITE_API_URL` points to the correct backend address during build.
-   In production, it's recommended to expose both services via a reverse proxy (e.g., Traefik, Nginx, Caddy) or unify them under a single domain.
